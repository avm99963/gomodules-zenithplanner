# Project Plan: ZenithPlanner

## Project Goal

To create a personal application, **ZenithPlanner**, inspired by "Cadiretis",
that helps track daily study/work locations and vacation days using **Google
Calendar as the primary interface**. The application aims to provide a clear,
color-coded overview of planned activities within Google Calendar, foster focus
by establishing a daily plan, and enable simple statistical analysis of time
allocation (visualized via **Grafana**). This is a personal project for
learning, organizational benefit, and replicating a valued workflow.
